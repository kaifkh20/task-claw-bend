## bookinfo.com: Book Management API (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

This project provides the back-end API for the `task-claw-fend` book management application, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It offers a RESTful API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book data.

**API Endpoints:**
* **POST /login** Login User
* **POST /signup** Signup User
* **GET /books:** Retrieves a list of all books in the database.
* **GET /books/:id:** Retrieves a single book by its unique identifier.
* **POST /books:** Creates a new book with the provided details.
* **PUT /books/:id:** Updates an existing book with the specified changes.
* **DELETE /books/:id:** Deletes a book from the database.

**Data Validation and Error Handling:**

* Incoming data for book fields (title, author, genre, year published) is validated to ensure data integrity.
* Errors are handled gracefully, and appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive messages are returned to the client.

**Database Integration:**

* MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database to store book data.
* Mongoose models define the data schema for books and provide methods for interacting with the database.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaifkh20/task-claw-fend-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd task-claw-fend-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

This will start the Node.js server, typically listening on port `3000` by default.

**Usage:**

You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or by making HTTP requests from your front-end application. Refer to the specific API documentation for each endpoint's expected request format and response structure.

**Error Handling:**

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of requests:

* **200 OK:** Success
* **400 Bad Request:** Invalid request data
* **404 Not Found:** Resource not found (e.g., book with a specific ID)
* **500 Internal Server Error:** Unexpected error
mber to replace placeholders with your specific configurations and consider adding more details about authentication or security if applicable in your production environment.
